- **Recharts** (Composable charting library)

## ✨ Key Features

- **Dark Mode Support**: Seamless toggle between Light and Dark modes with persistent `localStorage` integration.
- **Extensive Routing**: Over 15 distinct pages perfectly structured to represent university departments including Academics, Placement, Research, Administration, and Life @ IIITP.
- **Interactive UI Components**: Includes a 70vh Hero Carousel, animated viewport counters, a scrolling news ticker, tabbed important links, and an interactive Information Desk.
- **Data Visualizations**: Integrated Recharts for rendering rich placement trends over the years.
- **Fully Responsive**: A mobile-first design that adapts elegantly to any screen size, complete with an animated slide-down mobile navigation menu.
