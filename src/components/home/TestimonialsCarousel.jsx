    quote: 'My placement journey has been full of ups and downs, and it has taught me a lot about patience, persistence, and self-belief. There were times when I had to wait for a long period, and the process was not always easy. Cracking OAs and facing interviews came with their own pressure and challenges, and there were moments of doubt as well. But through all of it, I kept moving forward, and today I can say that the struggle was truly worth it. This experience has made me stronger, more confident, and better prepared for the professional world. It taught me that success does not come instantly; it comes through consistent effort, learning, and perseverance. I am especially thankful to the placement cell and my college for their constant support, guidance, and encouragement throughout this journey. Their help played a very important role in keeping me motivated and focused. I will always remain grateful to them for being a part of this memorable phase of my life.'
